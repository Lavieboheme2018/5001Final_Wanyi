# Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive analysis of Vancouver's house sales data spanning the years 2019-2020. This analysis was utilized to construct a predictive model for housing prices in the Vancouver area. Accompanying the analysis and model, a detailed report documenting the design process is provided for ease of understanding and reference.

# Repository Structure

Main: This directory houses the complete analytical report and the dataset utilized for the project.
other three are distinct modeling approaches were implemented:
  - Linear Regression Model
  - Random Forest Model
  - Gradient Boosting Model

# Each model directory contains:
- The py file for running the model.
- A consistent dataset, replicated across branches to allow for standalone operation of each script. This is done to ensure that users can execute the code without the need to alter directory paths or filenames.
- An Output Chart showcasing the model's results, enabling a quick review without the need for executing the script again.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the Analytical Report pdf in main file: Begin by downloading the full report from the Main directory to understand the project's scope and methodology.
2. Model Exploration: Proceed to download the individual branches corresponding to the different models.
3. Running the Models / Viewing Results: You can choose to either run the Python scripts within each branch to generate fresh output or view the pre-generated charts included alongside for immediate analysis.

## lastly

This project was a challenging task pushing the boundaries of my data analysis and python skills. Proud of what i did so far, your feedback with this project are highly appreciated:)
